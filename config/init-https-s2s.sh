# The S2S metadata service returns information about the specified search service
# At present the S2S service does not appear to be able to resolve RDF over HTTPS 
# so the S2S config RDF will have to be loaded over HTTP before the metadata service
# can work with search service instances that use HTTPS

# This script should be run after redeploying the S2S servlet to load the S2S config RDF over HTTP
